    <prop>Properities of S-Block Elements</prop>
    <info>
-The s block elements having only one electron in their s-orbital are called group one or alkali metals whereas the s block elements having two electrons filling their s-orbital are called group two or alkaline earth metals.
-Both alkali and alkaline earth elements show a regular gradation in their properties among their respective group elements. 
-But the first member of both S block elements, namely, Lithium and Beryllium differ much from the rest of their members but at the same time, they resemble more with the diagonal element present in the next column.

-The anomaly of these S block elements is due to:
1. Low atomic and ionic size
2. Greater charge density (charge/volume of the atom)
3. Greater polarization
4. Absence of d-orbitals.
5. Greater polarization of s block elements makes the first element more covalent and differentiates them from the rest which are ionic.
-The similarity in size and charge density makes them resemble the element diagonally placed in the next group 
(diagonal relationship).

    <prop>Properities of P-Block Elements</prop>
    <info> 
-P block elements are in which the last electron enters any of the three p-orbitals of their respective shells. 
-Since a p-subshell has three degenerate p-orbitals each of which can accommodate two electrons therefore in all there are six groups of p-block elements.
-P block elements are shiny and usually a good conductor of electricity and heat as they have a tendency to lose an electron. 
-You will find some amazing properties of elements in a P-block element like gallium. It’s a metal that can melt in the palm of your hand. 
-Silicon is also one of the most important metalloids of the p-block group as it is an important component of glass.
-You must have seen that coal is used in villages to cook food. It is nothing but a P-block element i.e. carbon. 
-Diamonds are used for making beautiful ornaments are also made up of carbon. 
-Aluminium foil made up of aluminium is also made up of the p block element.

Transition Elements are so named, indicating their positioning and transition of properties between, s and p block elements. So, all the transition metals are d block elements but all d block elements are not transition elements.
Characteristics of P-Block:
1. The general electronic configuration of p-block elements is ns2np1-6(except He). Whereas the inner core electronic configuration may differ. Just because of this difference the inner core, there are changes in both physical and chemical properties of the elements.
2. The oxidation state of elements in p – block is maximum when it is equal to a total number of valence electrons i.e. the sum of S and P electrons. One of the most interesting facts about the p-block elements is that it contains both non-metals and metalloids.

    <prop>Properities of D-Block Elements</prop>
    <info>
-D block elements are the elements which can be found from the third group to the twelfth group of the modern periodic table. 
-The valence electrons of these elements fall under the d orbital. 
-D block elements are also referred to as transition elements or transition metals.	
-Elements having electrons (1 to 10) present in the d-orbital of the penultimate energy level and in the outer most ‘s’ orbital (1-2) are d block elements. 
-Although electrons do not fill up ‘d’ orbital in the group 12 metals, their chemistry is similar in many ways to that of the preceding groups, and so considered as d block elements.
-Transition elements occupy groups 4–11. Scandium and yttrium of group 3, having a partially filled d subshell in the metallic state also are considered as transitions elements. 
-Elements like Zn, CD and Hg of the 12 column of the d block have completely filled d-orbital and hence are not considered as transition elements.
-Transition Elements are so named, indicating their positioning and transition of properties between, s and p block elements. So, all the transition metals are d block elements but all d block elements are not transition elements.

Properties of D-Block:
1. Electrons added to the ‘d’ sub-orbitals that lie between their (n+1) s and (n+1) p sub-orbitals.
2. Placed between s and p block elements in the periodic table.
3. Properties between s and p-block elements.

    <prop>Properities of F-Block Elements</prop>
    <info>
-Elements whose f orbital getting filled up by electrons are called f block elements. 
-These elements have electrons, (1 to 14) in the f orbital, (0 to 1) in the d orbital of the penultimate energy level and in the outermost’s orbital.
-There are two series in the f block corresponding to the filling up of 4f and 5f orbitals. 
-The elements are 4f series of Ce to Lu and 5f series of Th to Lw. There are 14 elements filling up the ‘f’ orbital in each series.
-The elements belonging to the f block are further differentiated into:
-The first series of elements are called lanthanides and include elements with atomic numbers beginning from 57 and ending at 71. These elements are non-radioactive (except for promethium, which is radioactive).
-The second series of elements are called actinides and include elements with atomic numbers beginning from 89 and ending at 103. These elements generally have a radioactive nature.
1. Have electrons added to the ‘f’ sub-orbitals of (n-2) level
2. Are placed between (n-1)d and ns block elements in the periodic table.
3. Properties are similar to d-block elements.

Properties of Lanthanides
1. Lanthanides are soft metals with a silvery white colour.
2. Their colour dulls and their brightness reduces rapidly when exposed to air.
3. They have melting points ranging from 1000K to 1200K (Except Samarium, 1623K).
4. Lanthanides are good conductors of heat and electricity.
5. They are non-radioactive in nature with the exception of Promethium
6. A decrease in atomic and ionic radii from lanthanum to lutetium is observed. This is called the lanthanoid contraction.

Properties of Actinides
1. The Actinide elements appear to be silvery in colour.
2. These elements have a radioactive nature.
3. These metals are highly reactive and their reactivity increases when they are finely divided.
4. A decrease in atomic and ionic radii from Actinium to Lawrencium is observed. This is called the actinoid contraction.
5. They generally exhibit an oxidation state of +3. However, elements belonging to the first half of the series are known to exhibit higher oxidation states quite frequently.
